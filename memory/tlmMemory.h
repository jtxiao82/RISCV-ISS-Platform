/* Derived from TLM examples memory.cpp by Imperas Software LTD.
 *
 * This is an example of a memory model with a TLM interface.
 *
 * It is not sparse, so requires as much virtual memory as it's size
 * in bytes.. For example, on the 32bit host a memory > 2G will generally
 * fail to load.
 *
 * The memory supports DMI, which is turned ON by default.
 *
 * To turn off DMI and invalidate DMI active regions.
 * instance.stopDMI();
 *
 * To turn DMI on again.
 * instance.startDMI();
